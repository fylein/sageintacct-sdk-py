# Sage Intacct SDK
Python SDK to access Sage Intacct web services

## Installation

This project requires [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library (pip install requests).

1. Download this project and use it (copy it in your project, etc).
2. Install it from [pip](https://pypi.org).
        
        $ pip install sageintacctsdk

## Usage

To use this SDK you'll need these Sage Intacct credentials used for authentication: **sender ID**, **sender password**, **user ID**, **company ID** and **user password**.

This SDK is very easy to use.
1. First you'll need to create a connection using the main class SageIntacctSDK.
```python
from sageintacctsdk import SageIntacctSDK

connection = SageIntacctSDK(
    sender_id='<YOUR SENDER ID>',
    sender_password='<YOUR SENDER PASSWORD>',
    user_id='<YOUR USER ID>',
    company_id='<YOUR COMPANY ID>',
    user_password='<YOUR USER PASSWORD>'
)
```
2. After that you'll be able to access any of the 22 API classes: accounts, ap_payments, ar_invoices, attachments, bills, charge_card_accounts, charge_card_transactions, checking_accounts, contacts, customers, departments, employees, expense_payment_types, expense_reports, expense_types, items, locations, projects, reimbursements, savings_accounts, tasks, and vendors.

                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
response = connection.employees.post(data)

# Use get_all methods to get all objects of certain types
response = connection.accounts.get_all()

# Get details of Employee with EMPLOYEEID E101
response = connection.employees.get(field='EMPLOYEEID', value='E101')
```
